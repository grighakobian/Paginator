# The Movie Database (TMDB) Sample Project

This is a sample project demonstrating how to use the Pagination library. The project fetches data from The Movie Database ([TMDB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3)) API.

This project showcases the implementation of pagination in a real-world scenario using the `Pagination` library. It interacts with the TMDB API to retrieve movie data and displays it in a paginated format.
